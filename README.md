An effort to master backend engineering through simulataneous learning of Go. While I am trained as a full-stack developer, I have admitedly not used my backend knowledge that much over my past four years as a TSE. As I would like to become a backend engineer, I have decided to focus on one language and learn it as a means for reengaging with backend architecture.

In my initial reading up on Go, I stumbled across this straightforward, practical guide to learning and using Go, which also elaborates on key backend ideas and practices. In an effort to move forward at a reasonable pace, without losing focus, I've decided to go chapter by chapter through this guide and commit my learning and discoveries along the way. 

## End Goal
To build out several servers on AWS that provide real world utility of some kind.
