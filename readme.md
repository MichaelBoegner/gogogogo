# Learning Go through Test-Driven Development
https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/

## Approach
After four years as a TSE, with education from Bloomtech, which consisted of Full-Stack Web Dev and 
Computer Science training for 40 hours a week for 8 months, I would like to live in the forbidden lands 
of backend engineering. While my first language was Javascript, and I was exposed significantly to Python 
and C, I have decided to learn Go as a means towards achieving my ends. 

I will expound more on reasons later, but for the sake of getting back to learning, if anyone comes 
across this, I am learning Go by iterating through each chapter at the site linked above, which
has a rigorous focus on a strict TDD/refactoring cycle. I am also currently searching for open source projects
and reading the below texts. 

Kindly,\
Michael
