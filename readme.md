# Learning Go through Test-Driven Development

## Approach
After four years as a TSE, with education from Bloomtech, which consisted of Full-Stack Web Dev and 
Computer Science training for 40 hours a week for 8 months, I would like to live in the forbidden lands 
of backend engineering. While my first language was Javascript, and I was exposed significantly to Python 
and C, I have decided to learn Go as a means towards achieving my ends. 

I will expound more on reasons later, but for the sake of getting back to learning, if anyone comes 
across this, I am learning Go by iterating through each chapter at the site linked above, which
has a rigorous focus on a strict TDD/refactoring cycle. After working through a majority of the lessons, I've 
found that a lot of assumptions are made in that work about the reader's knowledge base. Digital Ocean 
also provides a good Go tutorial that is equal verbose and detailed in its explanation as Quii's TDD 
is in brevity and vagueness. Therefore, they couple very well. When I don't understand something in Quii's
work, I move over to Digital Ocean and spend time there. I know I'm ready to move on when I can understand
what Quii is talking about without having to reference Digital Ocean. 

Kindly,\
Michael
